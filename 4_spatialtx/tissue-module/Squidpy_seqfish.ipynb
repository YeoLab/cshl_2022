    "high score and can be defined as being *enriched*. On the other hand, if\n",
    "they are far apart, the score will be low and they can be defined as\n",
    "*depleted*. This score is based on a permutation-based test, and you can\n",
    "set the number of permutations with the [n\\_perms]{.title-ref} argument\n",
    "(default is 1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the function works on a connectivity matrix, we need to compute\n",
