    "- **Shell/Bash**: A shell is a user interface, which can either be graphical (GUI) or command-line (CLI). Bash is a shell that is natively installed on MacOS and many Unix distributions and interprets the commands entered into the default terminal. You can think of running \"Bash\" as similar to running \"Python\" or \"Perl\", but instead of interpreting Python or Perl scripts, will interpret Bash (or \"sh\") commands.\n",
    "- **.bashrc**: A hidden script (files prefixed with a period \"```.```\" will be typically hidden from view by default) that provides instructions to run upon login. A ```.bashrc``` file may set/unset/modify environment variables, alias certain commands, or import and run other scripts. "
